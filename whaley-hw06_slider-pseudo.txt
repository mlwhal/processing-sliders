Pseudocode for interactive sketch using objects.

Objective: Sketch a set of three interactive sliders that change the fill color of a square ("test window") on the screen. Use objects.

--Variable initialization:
Initialize three slider objects
Set variables for the default fill color of the test window

--void setup:
Screen size
Background color and simple diagonal design
Text instructions for moving the sliders with the mouse, and resetting with a keystroke
Instantiate new slider objects at three different y positions and with three different fill colors

--void draw:
Draw test window with default fill color
Call display method for three slider objects

--void mouseDragged:
Call drag method for three slider objects
Change variables for fill colors of test window
Print fill color values for debugging purposes

--void keyPressed:
Reset variables for fill colors of test window to 0
Call reset method for slider objects

--class Slider:
Define variables for:
  x position of slider rectangles
  width and height of rectangles
  Boolean variable to test whether the mouse is inside the slider
Declare variable for y position of sliders w/no starting value

--Constructor method for Slider:
Two parameters: int yPosition and color slideCol
Set y variable to yPosition
Set slideColor variable to slideCol

--Display method
Draw invariant components of slider (rectangle and line) with 'y' for y coordinate
Set fill color of slider button to slideColor variable
Draw slider button
If mouse is inside slider rectangle, fill color changes to white

--Drag method
Test whether the mouse is inside the slider rectangle and set boolean variable accordingly
Move slider incrementally on x axis if mouse is inside slider
Limit range of x to the line on which the slider is drawn

--Reset method
Set x variable back to original value
